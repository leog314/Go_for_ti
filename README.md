The code for the game was written in Lua. Note that it can only be used on Ti-nspire calculators (mainly the cx cas and cx cas II).
Work is still in progress, mistakes in the game logic can occure. 

Note: suicude isn`t prohibited yet. 

If you want to edit the source code and recompile it you should use the Luna compiler from .lua to .tns: https://github.com/ndless-nspire/Luna
